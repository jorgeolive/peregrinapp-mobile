## üß™ Testing with Multiple Emulators

To fully test social features, you can run multiple Android emulators simultaneously:

### Quick Setup

1. Open a terminal and start the first emulator:
   ```bash
   emulator -avd Medium_Phone_API_36 -port 5554
   ```

2. Open another terminal tab and start the second emulator:
   ```bash
   emulator -avd Pixel_9_Pro -port 5556
   ```

3. In a third terminal tab, build and run the application:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```

4. Force install the APK into the second emulator:
   ```bash
   adb -s emulator-5556 install -r D:\UOC\TFG\peregrinapp-mobile\android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
   ```

### Detailed Setup

1. List available emulators:
   ```bash
   emulator -list-avds
   ```

2. Start emulators on different ports:
   ```bash
   # First emulator
   emulator -avd EmulatorName1 -port 5554
   
   # Second emulator
   emulator -avd EmulatorName2 -port 5556
   ```

3. Verify both devices are running:
   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```

4. Run the app on specific emulators:
   ```bash
   # List available devices
   npx expo run:android --list
   
   # Run on first emulator
   npx expo run:android --device "Pixel_6_API_33"
   
   # Run on second emulator
   npx expo run:android --device "Pixel_7_API_34"
   ```

5. Simulate different locations for testing:
   ```bash
   # Set first emulator's position (Camino Norte coordinates)
   adb -s emulator-5554 emu geo fix -8.544844 42.880447
   
   # Set second emulator's position (nearby location)
   adb -s emulator-5556 emu geo fix -8.543901 42.879986
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Building APK Files

To create APKs for deployment or testing:

1. Create a development build APK:
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild --platform android
   cd android
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
   This creates an APK at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

2. Create a release APK (for distribution testing):
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```
   The release APK will be at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
